Mzalendo Live Crime reporting platform
=======================


**This simple crime & corruption reporting website where any person can report a crime or corruption incident that is currently happening now or happened earlier.

The reports are then reflected as live data in the Mzalendo community page. Data would be broken down into simple & understandable categories.**


##Specifications
-----------------
- It can allow a user to submit a crime/corruption incident or a commendation.


- It would allow a user to sign-up & login. (Note that this is a mock-up/simulation)

- It would allow a user access the community page through a login.

- It simulates the visualization of data that would be reported. This is implemented through a JavaScript slip function.
